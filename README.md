# Final-Project
Obsessive analytics: A dive into OCD patient data
## Project/Goals
-Examine the impact of family history, gender, ethnicity and age on the manifestation of obsessions and compulsions
-Make use of the tools that I learnt; Python, SQL, Excel and Tableau to make sense of the data

## Process
I got a dataset from Kaggle once I decided tha I wanted to look in to mental health
I used the following tech tools;

Python
EDA to understand the data summary and structure, as well as converting any inaccurate data types

SQL
Data extraction aand grouping to answer questions

Excel
Use of pivot tables to elicit information and potential alternative dashboard

Tableau
Data visualization and story telling

Microsoft PowerPoint
Compilation and presentation of project

## Results
There were small weak positive and negative correlations. The highest, though still quite weak was a small positive correlation between Y-BOCS score for compulsion and symptom duration. This suggests that the linear relationships between these variables are not strong and there is a need for deeper statistical analyses to draw more conclusions about the relationships between the variables.

In terms of family history, 49.3% of the patients did not have a family history of OCD whil 50.7% did. The difference is not significant, therefore, having a family member with a history of OCD is not necessarily a precursor to develop it.

Female vs Male; 49.8% vs 50.2%; Males had slightly higher presence of OCD, with slightly lower severity score of 20.20 vs 19.90. However, both scores fall under moderate severity. The scale is as follows; 0-7 subclinical, 8-15 mild, 16-23 moderate, 24-31 severe and 32-40 extreme

Females had higher numbers in harm related and hoarding obsessions, while males had higher numbers in contamination, symmetry and religious obsessions.

The obsessions with the highest hold on people was harm related, followed by contamination, religious, symmetry and hoarding respectively.
Hoarding had the highest Y-BOCS obsession score of 21.01. Contamination and symmetry were a joint second in high scores with 19.67 and lastly religion with 19.23. Of note is the fact that though the scores differ, they all fall under moderate severity.

It was interesting to note that Obsession types result in the same compulsion types but with different occurrences of the compulsion types across the obsession. The highest compulsion for harm-related obsession is counting, while the lowest is checking. For Contamination, the highest compulsion is praying, while the lowest is counting. For Symmetry obsession, the highest compulsion is counting, while the lowest is praying. For hoard obsession, highest compulsion is washing while the lowest is praying. Finally, for religious obsession, the highest compulsion is washing, while praying and counting are joint lowest.

The ethnicities had varied results. The least affected ethnicity was Africans, followed by Asians, Hispanics then caucasians. While Africans had the least Y-BOCS score and Hispanics the most, all four ethnicities had an average score falling under moderate.
The compulsion most common in Africans was washing, while the least was praying. For Hispanics, the most common compulsion was washing, with checking being the least. For Asians, washing, checking and counting was joint first, while praying was last. For caucasians, the most common compulsion was checking with ordering being the least.
More on this is shown in the graph below;

It was interesting to note that age did not seem to have an effect on the compulsions. An example is age and the washing compulsion. This compulsion seemed to be normally distributed across the different age demographics, thereby discounting a pattern based on age. This is shown in the graph below;

The Powerpoint presentation and the Tableau workbook and dashboard images contain more graphics of the results.


## Future Goals

Make use of medication data to see the effects of different drug types.
Find if there is a connection between marital status and education level and obsession/compulsion types.
Possibly include predictions of future cases of diagnosis based on prior diagnosis.
